      <hr />
      <p>
        My name is Karam. I'm an ambitious software engineering student hailing
        from Amman, Jordan. <br />
        I'm currently studying for my Bachelor's degree at the Budapest
        University of Technology and Economics. My interests in the field of
        computer science are mostly related to the applications of data science
        and machine learning. <br />
        In my free time, I play football, lift weights, and enjoy reading
        philosophy.

          I studied for 12 years in the National Orthodox School. From the 9th
          grade till graduation, I studied the British system, IGCSE O-Levels
          and A-Levels (IAL). For my A-Levels. I studied Physics, Mathematics,
          Arabic, and Chemistry (AS-level only). Funnily enough, I did not study
          ICT or Computer Science in high school.

          Fun Fact: I studied Civil Engineering for a year before switching to
          Computer Science Engineering, yet I studied both in Budapest
          University of Technology and Economics (BME), which was founded in
          1782. The university was the first institute in Europe to train
          engineers at university level, and according to Wikipedia, it is
          considered the world's oldest institute of technology which has
          university rank and structure.
