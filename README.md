# Kabu's Portfolio Website

Welcome to the repository for my personal portfolio website! This site tells part of my story and projects as a developer. The website is built using Angular/TS/HTML/CSS and hosted by GitHub Pages.

- You can learn more about GitHub Pages hosting [here](https://pages.github.com/).  
- Check out the live website here: [https://kabu03.github.io/](https://kabu03.github.io/)  
- You can also find me on LinkedIn [here](https://www.linkedin.com/in/karam-abu-judom/).

#### Brief Explanation of Important Files and Folders

- `angular.json`: This file is the primary configuration file for an Angular project. It stores information about the project's architecture, dependencies, build and test configurations, and other settings.  

- `package.json`: This file lists the packages my project depends on, and specifies which versions of the packages to use. Uses semantic versioning rules, which you can read more about [here](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-semantic-versioning).  

- `src/`: This is where the main Angular code lives. It includes `app/`, `/assets`, etc.  

- `.gitignore`: Use this file to avoid committing `node_modules/`, `dist/`, environment files (if any are used by Angular), etc. to GitHub  

Thanks for visiting!
